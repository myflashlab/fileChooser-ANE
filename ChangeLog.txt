* Optimized for [ANE-LAB software](https://github.com/myflashlab/ANE-LAB).

* Updated with the new OverrideAir ANE.
* Even if you are building for iOS only, you still need to add the OverrideAir dependency.

*Nov 10, 2016 - V4.1.0*
* Optimized for Android manual permissions if you are targeting AIR SDK 24+
* From now on, this ANE will depend on androidSupport.ane and overrideAir.ane on the Android side

* Fixed missing onError dispatch on Android platform when no file was selected by the user

* Fixed resizing/scaling of images in Android and iOS


*Jan 21, 2016 - V4.0.0*
* Now you can optionally resize an image with native speed as soon as you pick an image. simply pass in an object like this _ex.choose("image/*", "pick an image!", {width:500, height:500, quality:50});
* bypassing xCode 7.2 bug causing iOS conflict when compiling with AirSDK 20 without waiting on Adobe or Apple to fix the problem. This is a must have upgrade for your app to make sure you can compile multiple ANEs in your project with AirSDK 20 or greater. https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2055508 https://forums.adobe.com/message/8294948
